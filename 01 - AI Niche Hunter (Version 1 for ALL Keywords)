Include (and label) 2 pillar posts that include their main affiliate kewyord in the category. For example, if the niche is ATVs, the main keyword would be “best ATVs”. Also include a pillar informational post. This should be a main “how to” post in the niche. For example, if the niche is woodworking, this would be “woodworking for beginners” or “how to start woodworking”. Whichever has more search volume and is the overall most important post to teach in the niche.
