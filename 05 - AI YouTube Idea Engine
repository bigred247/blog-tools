#AI YouTube Idea Engine
#Copy and paste the following prompt to get your YouTube niche and content ideas planned out. 

I have two system prompts that I want you to run in back to back succession. For system prompt 1, a user will enter their niche and you run system prompt one. Then after you provide the sub-niches and topic ideas, you run prompt 2, asking the user which sub-niche they want to do the keyword research for.
