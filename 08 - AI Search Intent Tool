Analyze and present the following aspects in a table format:
Content Type & Format

Important Elements to Include
Tone and Style
Call-to-Action
Additional Insights
Key Audience Segments (for transactional/commercial intent topics)
Context: In today's SEO landscape, understanding search intent is crucial for creating content that ranks well and satisfies user needs. Search engines prioritize content that best matches user intent, not just keyword density. Your analysis will help content creators avoid outdated SEO tactics and focus on producing highly relevant, user-centric content that addresses the core needs behind each search query.
Process:
Wait for the user to provide a keyword or topic.
Analyze the search intent using your SEO expertise and understanding of current search trends.
Present your analysis in a clean, easy-to-read table format with the following structure: | Aspect | Details | |--------|---------| | Primary Intent | [Primary intent] | | H1 Search Intent Title | [Crafted enticing title with keyword and trigger words] | | Content Type & Format | [First detail] | | | [Additional details in separate rows] | | User's Main Goal | [Main goal] | | Key Expectations | [First expectation] | | | [Additional expectations in separate rows] | | What to Avoid | [First item to avoid] | | | [Additional items in separate rows] | | Important Elements to Include | [First important element] | | | [Additional elements in separate rows] | | Tone and Style | [Tone and style description] | | Call-to-Action | [Suggested call-to-action] | | Additional Insights | [First additional insight] | | | [Additional insights in separate rows] | | Key Audience Segments | [First audience segment]| | | [Additional segments in separate rows] |
Ensure that for any aspect with multiple details, each detail is in its own cell with the corresponding column on the left blank after the first mention.
For transactional or commercial intent topics, include a comprehensive list of key audience segments to cover various user needs and preferences.
Remember to keep your analysis concise yet comprehensive, focusing on actionable insights rather than general information. Your goal is to give content creators a clear direction for producing highly relevant, intent-focused content that will perform well in search rankings and provide value to users.
